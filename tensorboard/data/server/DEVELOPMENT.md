# Using Rust in TensorBoard

## Building

The `//tensorboard/data/server` package can be built with Bazel. It builds
hermetically and with no additional setup. If you like using `bazel build`,
`bazel run`, and `bazel test`, you can stop reading now.

This package can also be built with Cargo, the standard Rust toolchain. You
might want to use Cargo:

-   …to use the `rust-analyzer` language server in your editor of choice.
-   …to use tools like `cargo clippy` (a linter) or `cargo geiger` (an auditor
    for unsafe code) or `cargo tree` (to show the crate dependency graph).
-   …to use `cargo raze` to generate Bazel build files from the Cargo package
    structure.
-   …to use other Rust toolchains, like the beta or nightly channels.
-   …to cross-compile.
-   …simply because you’re more familiar with it or prefer it.

To build with Cargo, change into the `tensorboard/data/server/` directory and
use standard Cargo commands, like `cargo build --release` or `cargo test`.
Running `cargo raze` from within `tensorboard/data/server/` will update the
build files under `third_party/rust/`, using `Cargo.toml` as the source of
truth.

You should be able to use `rust-analyzer` without doing anything special or
changing into the `tensorboard/data/server/` subdirectory: just open one of the
Rust source files in your editor. For editor setup, consult
[the `rust-analyzer` docs][ra-docs].

## Adding third-party dependencies

Rust dependencies are usually hosted on [crates.io]. We use [`cargo-raze`][raze]
to automatically generate Bazel build files for these third-party dependencies.

The source of truth for `cargo-raze` is the `Cargo.toml` file. To add a new
dependency:

1.  Run `cargo install cargo-raze` to ensure that you have [`cargo-raze`][raze]
    installed.
2.  Add an entry to the `[dependencies]` section of `Cargo.toml`. The new line
    should look like `rand = "0.7.3"`. You can find the most recent version of a
    package on <https://crates.io/>.
3.  Change into the `tensorboard/data/server/` directory.
4.  Run `cargo generate-lockfile` to update `Cargo.lock`. Running this before
    `cargo raze` ensures that the `http_archive` workspace rules in the
    generated build files will have `sha256` checksums.
4.  Run `cargo raze` to update `third_party/rust/...`.

This will add a new target like `//third_party/rust:rand`. Manually build it
with Bazel to ensure that it works: `bazel build //third_party/rust:rand`. If
the build fails, you’ll need to teach `cargo-raze` how to handle this package by
adding crate-specific metadata to a `[raze.crates.CRATE-NAME.VERSION]` section
of the `Cargo.toml` file. Failure modes may include:

-   The package uses a `build.rs` script to generate code at compile time.
    Solution: add `gen_buildrs = true`.
-   The package needs certain features to be enabled. Solution: add
    `additional_flags = ["--cfg=FEATURE_NAME"]`.

See `Cargo.toml` for prior art. Googlers: you may be able to glean some hints
from the corresponding Google-internal build files.

When done, commit the changes to `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and the
`third_party/rust/` directory.
